# knowledge-graph

This is a place to share the knowledge graph for this project.

The method and code for creating it is in https://github.com/diatomsRcool/eco-kg and will be iteratively updated over time.

The graph can be downloaded here (https://www.dropbox.com/s/utavv8n5dxr32vr/merged-kg.tar.gz?dl=0) as a 44MB tarball. There are two files in the tarball. One with nodes and another with edges. Documentation about the file format can be found here https://github.com/biolink/kgx/blob/master/specification/kgx-format.md.

The screen shot in this repo shows the output of the terminal after the final merge step. This has some helpful information about the number of nodes and edges merged between different data sources.

The final merge statistics can be found at https://github.com/diatomsRcool/eco-kg/blob/master/merged-kg_stats.yaml
